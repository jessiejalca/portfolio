      <h2>About Me.</h2>
      <p className="sub">
        In short, I'm a graphic-designer-turned-developer. These days, I like
        spending my free time building whatever cool thing pops into my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        My developer journey started back in 2016, when I took an AP Computer
        Science course. An innate puzzler, I loved it from the start. At the
        time, I thought it would just be a fun hobby, but about five years later
        I realized I wanted to make it my full-time job. And that's exactly what
        I've been working towards ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading, binging whatever sitcom I'm
        currently obsessed with, or playing soccer. My favorite thing to do is
        to dive deep into a good story - or live one out with my friends and
        family.
