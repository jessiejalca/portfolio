      <p className="sub">
        In short, I'm a graphic-designer-turned-developer. These days, I like
        spending my free time building whatever cool thing pops into my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        My developer journey started back in 2016, when I took an AP Computer
        Science course. At the time, I thought it would be just a fun hobby, but
        about five years later I realized I wanted to make it my full-time job.
        So, that's exactly what I've been working towards ever since.
